                <p class="belle text-center"> <br> Reflecting on this process, <br> I want to thank everyone for all their effort and support with Hour of Code, you've all been pillars in this project and your comittments made the Hour of Code the wonderful event it was.
                Marra, Thank you for being our advisor and main mentor of this project, the continous feedback you gave us and the models helped us thoroughly in the process. I enjoyed our in depth talks and the guidance you gave, you helped us grow as people.
                Petressi, Thank you very much for letting us borrow the chromebooks! We are very grateful for your company for providing us with computers which helped the students to start their Hour of Code. We greatly appreciate you for supporting our event and taking a chance of us.
                Dozer-Milbry, Thank you so much for giving us extra snacks for Hour of Code! We appreciate you considering us and going the extra mile to double your support. We were a bit worried that the snacks would not arrive on time, so we are very grateful for your donation and as it made it easier to manage the event.
                Antoz, Thank you for allowing the extra credit to given to the students who attended, plus the list of the Freshmen/Sophmore classes! I was able to walk and visit all the classes that were willing to hear my spiel. Your kindness regarding the issue made things a lot smoother.
                Barret, Thank you too for giving us the other cart of chromebooks to borrow! The students who didn't have any devices respected the devices and made great projects with them.
                Shortt, Thank you for helping us make connections with the other teachers to gain more devices granted us more than enough for each student to use them to their best ability.
                Mccoy, Thank you for accepting the use of your room, the computer lab was a enviroment that the students could sit close with friends as they solved the bugs of the project, along with that your supervision assisted our vision of a professional and education space.
                Without you all, the work that was put into this would've never reached the light of the Curtis students. We enjoyed the experience immensely, and if we had the chance, would want to plan the Hour of Code again next year. We hope the next students are even more capable than ourselves, and are able to use your assistance to greater abilities. 
                Again, each of you made Hour of Code the succesful event it was, and we are greatful for your presence in Curtis Highschool. Your work is seen and loved by those who you work towards. 
                  <br> We love you all!!<br>
